This is the file folder for data clean up work.

I created a python file and loaded the data file, it was successful and I have created a few tables and performed a basic list of car data.

The file is ready to be reviewed, hopefully this is helpful/

I will continue next on the number one high question.


This is the initial for folder for AAlvarez progress work.

I worked on cleaning the data on jupyter and retrieved some data per following the instruction. you can see the pynb file under my branch.

I will work on the first one.

I will create a python file using Jupyter notebook and continue on.

I created a python to answer one of the three high level question, which number is number 1. There are by most listed, ratings, and engine size. I also added graphs and a plot. Hope this works.

Drisk will work on the last part of high question 1.

This may be done by Drish- 04/06/2025- Define what is a popular car listing. Is it the number of listings of certain types of car?
Rating? Or something else?
