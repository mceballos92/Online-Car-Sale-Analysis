Working on second part; with three other high questions.
 
What car features or specs influence the price the most?
Break it down:

Which attributes (mileage, year, brand, fuel type, etc.) show the strongest correlation with price?

Are certain brands consistently priced higher across the same specs?

Ill attempt to create plots or bar charts.

First question. I will break down down to subset questions.

I made a python on What’s the average price for cars with low mileage vs. high mileage. Got some data but will continue to discover more on this since I am getting very little data back.



Created new branch, and worked on the second part.



The dealer with the most listing? resulted in being Echo Park Automotive Green with 36 lisiting.

and 

And list the least expensive car from each dealership.

April 27, 2025: Executed a list of the make with the most listings.

Top 5 car makes with the most listings:
make
BMW              944
Mercedes-Benz    810
Toyota           797
Honda            713
Ford             580

Another data set I got: The histogram shows how car prices are spread across your dataset.

Each bar represents a price range (like $10,000–$15,000, $15,000–$20,000, etc.).

The height of each bar shows how many cars fall into that price range.

This is the file folder for data clean up work.

I created a python file and loaded the data file, it was successful and I have created a few tables and performed a basic list of car data.

The file is ready to be reviewed, hopefully this is helpful/

I will continue next on the number one high question.



This is the initial for folder for AAlvarez progress work.

I worked on cleaning the data on jupyter and retrieved some data per following the instruction. you can see the pynb file under my branch.

I will work on the first one.

I will create a python file using Jupyter notebook and continue on.

I created a python to answer one of the three high level question, which number is number 1. There are by most listed, ratings, and engine size. I also added graphs and a plot. Hope this works.

Drisk will work on the last part of high question 1.

This may be done by Drish- 04/06/2025- Define what is a popular car listing. Is it the number of listings of certain types of car?
Rating? Or something else?
