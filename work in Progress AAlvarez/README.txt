Working on second part; with three other high questions.
 
What car features or specs influence the price the most?
Break it down:

Which attributes (mileage, year, brand, fuel type, etc.) show the strongest correlation with price?

Are certain brands consistently priced higher across the same specs?

Ill attempt to create plots or bar charts.

First question. I will break down down to subset questions.
