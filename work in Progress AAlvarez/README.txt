Working on second part; with three other high questions.
 
What car features or specs influence the price the most?
Break it down:

Which attributes (mileage, year, brand, fuel type, etc.) show the strongest correlation with price?

Are certain brands consistently priced higher across the same specs?

Ill attempt to create plots or bar charts.

First question. I will break down down to subset questions.

I made a python on Whatâ€™s the average price for cars with low mileage vs. high mileage. Got some data but will continue to discover more on this since I am getting very little data back.
